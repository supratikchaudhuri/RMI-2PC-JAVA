Understanding Distributed Systems: The 2PC protocol is a fundamental distributed systems concept that ensures atomicity across multiple participants in a distributed environment. By working on this project, I have deepened my understanding of distributed systems, their challenges, and the importance of coordination between different nodes.

RMI (Remote Method Invocation): Implementing interactions between participants and the coordinator using Java RMI introduced I to remote communication and object-oriented programming in a distributed setting. I may have learned about RMI's advantages, its underlying mechanisms, and how it simplifies communication between remote entities.

Concurrency and Synchronization: The 2PC protocol involves careful coordination and synchronization of participants' actions to ensure consistency. Dealing with concurrent access to shared resources and managing synchronization to prevent race conditions likely gave I insights into the complexities of handling concurrent operations.

Two-Phase Commit Protocol: By implementing the 2PC protocol, I would have gained a deep understanding of its two phases: the prepare phase and the commit/abort phase. I might have also learned how to handle scenarios like failures and timeouts during the protocol execution.

Fault Tolerance and Error Handling: In distributed systems, failures are inevitable. Working on the 2PC protocol would have exposed I to various failure scenarios and how to design for fault tolerance, ensuring that the system remains consistent and recoverable.

Transaction Management: The 2PC protocol is essentially a way to manage distributed transactions. I likely learned how to start, commit, or abort transactions, and how to ensure that all participants reach a consensus before the final commit.

Testing and Debugging Distributed Systems: Building a distributed system can be challenging, and debugging issues in such an environment can be even more complex. Through this project, I might have honed my skills in testing and debugging distributed systems effectively.

Communication and Collaboration: Since the 2PC protocol involves interactions between multiple participants, I might have gained experience in communication and collaboration, especially when designing the protocol's messages and ensuring that all components work together harmoniously.

Practical Application of Theory: Working on a project like this bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. I would have experienced firsthand how real-world scenarios might differ from idealized theoretical models.

Problem-Solving and Design Thinking: Implementing a distributed protocol involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. my project would have challenged my problem-solving skills and required a thoughtful approach to system design.
