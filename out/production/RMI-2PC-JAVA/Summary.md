## Key learnings from this project: 

1. **2 Phase Commit Protocol**: The 2PC protocol is a fundamental distributed systems concept that ensures atomicity across multiple participants in a distributed environment. By working on this project, I have deepened my understanding of distributed systems, their challenges, and the importance of coordination between different nodes.

2. **RMI (Remote Method Invocation):** Implementing interactions between participants and the coordinator using Java RMI introduced me to remote communication and object-oriented programming in a distributed setting. I  have learned about RMI's advantages, its underlying mechanisms, and how it simplifies communication between remote entities.

3. **Concurrency and Synchronization:** The 2PC protocol involves careful coordination and synchronization of participants' actions to ensure consistency. Dealing with concurrent access to shared resources and managing synchronization to prevent race conditions gave me insights into the complexities of handling concurrent operations.

4. **Two-Phase Commit Protocol:** By implementing the 2PC protocol, I have gained a deep understanding of its two phases: the prepare phase and the commit/abort phase. I  have also learned how to handle scenarios like failures and timeouts during the protocol execution.

5. **Fault Tolerance and Error Handling:** In distributed systems, failures are inevitable. Working on the 2PC protocol would have exposed I to various failure scenarios and how to design for fault tolerance, ensuring that the system remains consistent and recoverable.

6. **Transaction Management:** The 2PC protocol is essentially a way to manage distributed transactions. I learned how to start, commit, or abort transactions, and how to ensure that all participants reach a consensus before the final commit.

7. **Practical Application of Theory:** Working on a project like this bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. I would have experienced firsthand how real-world scenarios  differ from idealized theoretical models.

8. **Problem-Solving and Design Thinking:** Implementing a distributed protocol involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. My project has challenged my problem-solving skills and required a thoughtful approach to system design.
